# HP Prime Programming Language Support for VSCode

This extension provides **syntax highlighting**, **command auto-completion**, and **function documentation** for the **HP Prime Programming Language (HP PPL)** in **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**. It is based on the original Notepad++ HP Prime Programming Language extension, with enhancements for better integration into the VSCode environment.

## Features
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Keywords, operators, and functions are highlighted for easier reading and editing of HP PPL code.
- **Code Completion**: Provides suggestions for HP PPL keywords, functions, and syntax during code writing.
- **Function Documentation**: Integrated documentation for over 800 functions, including overloads, for quick reference as you code.

## Credits
This extension is inspired by the work done by the following individuals:
- **Juerg W. Buser**: The original author of most of the contents in `userDefineLang.xml` (2015). He can be contacted at `jwbuser@bluewin.ch`.
- **Terje Vallestad**: The contributor who extracted the function documentation from the HP Prime calculator (firmware revision 10077) and adapted it for use with Notepad++.
- **Eric Rechlin**: Developer and maintainer of the Notepad++ version, who helped optimize the integration of function documentation into Notepad++.

The original Notepad++ extension can be found at [https://www.hpcalc.org/details/7564](https://www.hpcalc.org/details/7564).

The function documentation, including the complete list of over 800 functions and their overloads, was adapted from Terje Vallestad's work to fit into this extension.
